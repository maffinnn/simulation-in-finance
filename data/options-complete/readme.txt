LONZA price: 331.30
SIKA price: 226.30

WARNING: 13/9 is empty, so used 12/9 to replace
18-21/8 (LONZA) all used 24/8 data because strike_num = 50, the maturity is not ranged
21-23/8 (SIKA) all used 24/8 data because not sure why the calibration has error
25-30/8 (LONZA all used 31/8 data) because strike = 50
- Next time need to run all the data once at least to check if there are any problems
with the model

There is a description for every maturity date, can use dropna to remove
Some rows have 0, might want to remove

Settings: strikes 10
