- Refer to script.py in code/
### Challenges
- taking sqrt(x) or log(x) where x is negative.
doing x**y where x is negative. Since y is real, there will be a fractional component, and a negative number to a fractional exponent is not a real number.
doing x/y where both x and y are 0.

- Refactoring

- Example Heston params that causes positive definite errors (Others are rho > 1 but solved by replacing the params on next day)
